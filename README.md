# React Digital Clock

A quick demo of how the [AdaGold/js-digital-clock](https://github.com/AdaGold/js-digital-clock) project would be implemented
using React, to demonstrate some of the differences between React and
traditional frameworks.

The `master` branch contains a version of the Clock app that doesn't use any ES6-only language features. Just the old JavaScript we've come to know and love. To see how this looks in ES6, jump on over to the `es6-version` branch!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running the App

To run the app, clone the repo locally and then run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

The second step will set up a server and automatically open a browser tab to it.
